# NodeJS-with-ReactJS

Recently I have created a Web Application with Backend with NodeJS and Frontend with React JS. It is basically a web application through which you can send emails to different people via SendGrid. You can only send emails to different people by adding credits to your account via Stripe. I have used the PassportJS library for authentication using Google Strategy. I have used MongoDB as my database.

I have hosted my Web Application on Heroku. Here is the link :- https://quiet-brook-02941.herokuapp.com

Currently I am working on a Bug the Stripe API is not working for Indian Address. Currently I am an working on it Sorry for that but u can use the Application by using a test Address as mentioned in Stripe API.

And you can use the test mode Credit Card Details.

Card Number :- 4242 4242 4242 4242
Expiry Date :- Any Date in the future
CVC :- Any three digit number(For eg :- 123)
